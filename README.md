I am a budding web developer trying to learn as much as possible. I have student experience with html, css, JavaScript, Java, and some PHP. 
I've taken two college level classes on html/css/JavaScript (one at Rasmussen College and one at Liberty university) and have completed the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate.
I've taken object oriented programming and advanced object oriented programming classes from Liberty university, both of which used Java as the instructional language.
I've also taken a database management systems class at Liberty University which covered the creation and use of ERDs and SQL.
I'm currently finishing up an undergraduate certificate in Web Development at Liberty University and taking LinkedIn Learning courses on PHP and REST API.
