# github-intro
I am a budding web developer trying to learn as much as possible. I have student experience with html, css, JavaScript, Java, and PHP. 
I completed an undergraduate certificate in Web Development at Liberty University in October 2020.
I'm currently working on learning the Symfony framework and building my portfolio.
